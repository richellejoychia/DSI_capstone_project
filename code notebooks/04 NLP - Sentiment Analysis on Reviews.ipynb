    "The purpose of this NLP step is to conduct a sentiment analysis (Hugging Face) to retrieve the emotions for each review and add the labels as an information for users in Streamlit. As mentioned in my introduction, people these days are bombarded with tons of information and to have to go through all the individual reviews to come up with a conclusion of whether or not this activity may be worth trying. Therefore, I would like to simplify this process by allowing users to have a snapshot of what people generally feel.\n",

    "# Conclusion \n",
    "In summary, this project aims to lay the foundation for a bigger goal, that is, to kick start a travel recommender system based on activity preferences in order to make travel planning a more efficient task. In this project, I was able to use Cosine Similarity, User Acceptance Testing, and A/B testing to improve the model predictions by 20%. \n",
    "- In the base model, 60% of the recommended attractions were found to be in line with users and what they would do.\n",
    "- In the main model, 80% of the recommended attractions were what people would be likely to do as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "This recommender system was deployed in Streamlit - [Click here to try!](https://richellejoychia-streamlit-apps-streamlit-app-wtufwn.streamlit.app/)\n",
    " \n",
    "# Limitations and future work\n",
    "Even though the results of the recommender system were satisfactory, there are still some limitations to consider for future work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The activities included were only in Canada and may not be as comprehensive. It would be interesting to scrap data from other countries and incorporate it into the recommender system such that users who like a particular attraction would be recommended attractions from other countries as well. \n",
    "- Only cosine similarity was used in building this recommender systemm. Future work can collect implicit feedback that are not ratings or scores provided by the user, such as clicks and participated activities. Thereafter, a hybrid recommender system can be implemented.\n",
    "- The data is still somewhat limited for a recommender system and future work can continue to collect more information from users to improve recommendations.\n",
    "- The NLP Hugging Face model is only used for category labelling. It would be interesting to create weights with the results and see whether positive, negative, or neutral emotions would influence the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for streamlit deployment,\n",
    "- It is best viewed on desktop due to the layout, which may not be convenient for most users. One possible solution would be to deploy this on a mobile app for easy access. \n",
    "- The radio button may not be the most intuitive for users to rate. Afterwhich, I would like to create a swipe function such that users can swipe the photo either right (like) or left (dislike) to indicate their preferences. Having a bigger button would suffice as well. These steps would allow smoother and more instantaneous response.\n",
    "- The filter on the sidebar is still a work in progress and future work can improve the future to ensure that when users click on the fliter, the filtered activities will follow suit.\n",
    "- Currently, there is only 1 emotion label that is being shown. It may be useful to incoporate more than 1. Moreover, future work can use different huggingface models to explore other labels. \n",
    "- Only 1 photo is being displayed and this photo may not be the most accurate. As such, it would be interesting to explore more photos or even short videos/reels in future. \n",
    "- There are only 6 recommendations and would be good to include an option for people to view more recommendations and rate whether or not they like the activity."
